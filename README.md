# HackWestern2

Basically some complete garbage app that we made for a hackathon.
The concept of this app was a "running" app that allowed you to compete with other friends and against yourself. The app would allow runners to be in different locations, and would sync up with friends to display your current speed vs a friends current speed as well as time elapsed and distance traveled. This would making running more fun when running together isn't an option physically, and also gives users benchmarks to work towards for their improvement.

As this was our first time using Pebble and Javascript, we had limited time and a lot of the solutions were very hacky. We ended up not being able to gather distance and speed data from the GPS as it was not sensitive enough, and we were also unable to connect our pebble watches to android devices due to the nature of Pebble.js (c would work, but we were unaware of this until much later). 

The app in its current state will generate random speeds for the user and his friend, and increase distance and time according to that generated speed. 

Overall, I would like to work with Pebble again but in a scenario where I had more time to explore my options further.
